Boosting-for-Classification
===========================
In this example I run boosting on decision stumps and show the power of boosting for classification problems.
This is a short description of each file:
decisionStump.m :Runs a Decision Stump on a Data Set.
adaBoost.m : Runs Boosting on a Model and Returns the New Model.
boostingDemo.m : Plots the result of a single decision stump and boosted decision stump.
binary.mat : This is the data.
